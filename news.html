                Houston-based private space company Axiom has forged a partnership with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a> to fly paying tourists to the ISS as soon as the second half of 2021. Under the terms of their deal, SpaceX will use the <span style="color: blue">Crew Dragon</span> capsule to ferry three tourists and an Axiom staff member, who'll make sure they don't interfere with the NASA crew members doing their job, to the orbiting lab. It's worth noting that Axiom was the company NASA chose to build the space station's first commercial destination module.

                In early 2001, Elon Musk donated US$100,000 to the Mars Society and joined its board of directors for a short time.[10]: 30–31  He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[11][12] Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr ICBM for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.[13] Two months later, however, the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty and created the Missile Defense Agency, increasing tensions with Russia and generating new strategic interest for rapid and re-usable launch capability similar to the DC-X.

                In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.[21] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations following the cancellation of the Brilliant Pebbles program.[22] By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[23] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.[24] Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten
